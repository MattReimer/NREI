*** MESSAGE Executable for 64-bits platform. 
*** MESSAGE Double precision computation using reals of kind    8 
*** MESSAGE Upwind advection scheme only near momentum discharges 
*** MESSAGE Using UNESCO density formulation by default 
*** MESSAGE Momentum solver cyclic method is specified 
*** MESSAGE DRYFLP and DPSOPT both specified in MD-file. Using DPSOPT: MAX 
*** WARNING Latitude of your model is 0 degrees, model located at equator
*** WARNING MAP stop time outside simulation period; will be reset 
*** WARNING HIS stop time outside simulation period; will be reset 
*** WARNING Comm. stop time outside period for writing file; will be reset 
*** WARNING Minimum layer thickness (0.1*Dryflc) is too large for the vertical 
            grid layering. Decrease Dryflc to smaller than     0.0005 m,
            to avoid problems with the vertical layering.
